        <span style="font-style:italic">Wii Sports</span> is a Wii game that was released in 2006 alongside the Wii’s release. <span style="font-style:italic">Wii Sports</span> was the single most popular game on the Wii and was widely responsible for its success. <span style="font-style:italic">Wii Sports</span> is the single highest selling game that released on a single console at over 82 million units sold, as well as being the fourth most sold game of all time. <span style="font-style:italic">Wii Sports</span> included five different sports you could play: golf, tennis, bowling, boxing, and baseball. Each game utilized the Wii Remotes unique motion capture to the fullest, making the games much more fun to play than if they were played on a traditional controller. The tennis game gave you a selection of options for your matches such as how many sets to play and how many CPU’s you wanted to play against. Golf gave you an extensive number of courses to test your skill on utilizing different wind speeds, clubs, and how hard you would need to swing the remote. Bowling has 2 different modes: a traditional game of bowling or 100 pin bowling. Boxing was the most physically draining game as it required the Nunchuk to throw both hands punches and required you to lean side to side to avoid your opponents’ punches. Lastly, baseball had all the core mechanics of baseball including three different types of throws the pitcher could use and requiring the batter to swing at the correct time and speed to hit the ball. All of these games included multiplayer on one console, making them addicting to play in groups with friends. <span style="font-style:italic">Wii Sports</span> sold for ~$20 to buy the game separately.
